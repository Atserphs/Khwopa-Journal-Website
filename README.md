# Introduction
Project for making Khwopa Journal Website dedicated to and on remembrance of extinct bird species (<b> Kauaʻi ʻōʻō </b>). I hope this website can grow and contribute in researcha and grow so that we could know about condition on different things in different field and can stop tragical incidents.
The main motivation behind this project it a tragic ending of whole avian family of (<b> Kauaʻi ʻōʻō </b>) without even a single close relative. They were originated from back in 15 to 20 million years but extinct in 20th century due to multiple driving force. For this we human can never forgive ourselves.
In this project I am developing journal website with at most possible to include latest feature to make it user friendly. from which I hope user will use it and can contribute some contibution in research even though that is small one.
